<title>Better writing</title>
<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&#34;The best way to become better at something is to fail at it 10000 times&#34; - some smart man probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been bothered by my procrastination to write even basic things like text messages for a long time. I hate to admit it but sometimes I lose hours composing even emails. Yes I&#39;m that bad at writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need help, and the most reliable help you can possibly get is yourself. Yes you heard it right I want to get better at it. And to implement what I already said is a good plan (read fist paragraph) I decided I&#39;m going to write here. Expect lots of weird information about writing linux servers and other similar projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if anybody has any cheatsheet or 10 quick tips article to master writing fast I&#39;m very interested because the prospect of writing lots (and failing) isn&#39;t very appealing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
